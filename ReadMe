This Project is of Low power mask detecting device using Tiny Ml .

Dataset have been taken from Kaggle .https://www.kaggle.com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
The final working demop of project can be seen here https://youtu.be/ujojaEP9YnU.
Code for the Machine learning model . https://www.kaggle.com/code/nishantsingh45/face-mask-detection-for-tiny-ml

##Hardware Used
1. Arduino Nano Ble Sense 
2. OV7670 CAMERA 
3. Wires 

##Software Used
1. Tensorflow 
2. Google Colab
3. arduino IDE

At first we will train the model over cloud and then convert the model into tflite format to deploy it to hardware . But Arduino nano dont understand Python so we need to convert it to buffer file 
So we will convert the model into c buffer and also quantize rhe model to reduce the size of model . 
After this we will use this file in our Arduino to run the model on hardware .
